            Hi there, my name is Muhammad Ali Malik. I am a full-time Information Technology student at York University,
            Resident Assistant, a programmer and a
            chronic learner.<br /> So far, I have not only been able to excel in my university courses but also been
            able to
            pursue programming endeavors on the side, alongside working a part-time job.<br />

            When I am not in class, studying algorithms or figuring out network protocols, I like to explore the world
            through reading self-development books, exercising outdoors<br /> and helping those around me!

            I like to spend my time productively, whether it is taking online technology courses, strengthening
            relationships with my residents or<br /> helping out my team. I am currently working on developing a course
            along
            with some of my peers that aims to teach programming fundamentals to incoming first years.
